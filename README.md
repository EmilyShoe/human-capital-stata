# OpenSDP Human Capital Analysis (Stata)

This repository contains web guides, Stata data visualization code, and sample data to help education data analysts answer questions about patterns and trends in teacher recruitment and retention. The Human Capital Analysis materials can also be accessed on the OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is adapted from code from the parts A and E of the "Analyze" section of the Human Capital Edition of the [Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use). It has been modified to work with a new synthetic data set.

## Repository Organization

Files in this repository are organized into the following folders:

 - `data` contains the synthesized student and teacher data used the Human Capital Analysis. See the included web guide for a description of the data files.
 - `docs` contains the RMarkdown documentation source and the generated documentation output in html and markdown format. See "About the Documentation" below for how to use these files.
 - `logs` contains the logs generated by the Stata code.
 - `programs` contains the Stata programs for the analysis.
 - `tables_figures` contains the figures generated by the analysis in Stata graph and EMF formats.

## About the Documentation

The documentation is written in RMarkdown (`.rmd`) format, with R and Stata code embedded into a markdown document. Building the HTML documents from these files requires the following:

 - An installation of Stata 14 or newer
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
 - The [Statamarkdown](https://github.com/Hemken/Statamarkdown) R library


 Open the `.rmd` files in RStudio, edit the code to reflect the location of the repository on your computer, and then use the "Knit" button to build the HTML documents with knitr. Knitting the documents will also regenerate the Stata output in the `tables_figures` folder.
